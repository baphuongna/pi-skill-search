# Scientific Schematics and Diagrams

## Overview

Scientific schematics and diagrams transform complex concepts into clear visual representations for publication. **This skill uses Nano Banana 2 AI for diagram generation with Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview quality review.**

**How it works:**
- Describe your diagram in natural language
- Nano Banana 2 generates publication-quality images automatically
- **Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview reviews quality** against document-type thresholds
- **Smart iteration**: Only regenerates if quality is below threshold
- Publication-ready output in minutes
- No coding, templates, or manual drawing required

**Quality Thresholds by Document Type:**
| Document Type | Threshold | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|

## Quick Start: Generate Any Diagram

Create any scientific diagram by simply describing it. Nano Banana 2 handles everything automatically with **smart iteration**:

```bash
# Generate for journal paper (highest quality threshold: 8.5/10)
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "CONSORT participant flow diagram with 500 screened, 150 excluded, 350 randomized" -o figures/consort.png --doc-type journal

# Generate for presentation (lower threshold: 6.5/10 - faster)
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "Transformer encoder-decoder architecture showing multi-head attention" -o figures/transformer.png --doc-type presentation

# Generate for poster (moderate threshold: 7.0/10)
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "MAPK signaling pathway from EGFR to gene transcription" -o figures/mapk_pathway.png --doc-type poster

# Custom max iterations (max 2)
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "Complex circuit diagram with op-amp, resistors, and capacitors" -o figures/circuit.png --iterations 2 --doc-type journal
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. **Generation 1**: Nano Banana 2 creates initial image following scientific diagram best practices
2. **Review 1**: **Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview** evaluates quality against document-type threshold
3. **Decision**: If quality >= threshold → **DONE** (no more iterations needed!)
4. **If below threshold**: Improved prompt based on critique, regenerate
5. **Repeat**: Until quality meets threshold OR max iterations reached

**Smart Iteration Benefits:**
- ✅ Saves API calls if first generation is good enough
- ✅ Higher quality standards for journal papers
- ✅ Faster turnaround for presentations/posters

### AI Generation Best Practices

**Effective Prompts for Scientific Diagrams:**

✓ **Good prompts** (specific, detailed):
- "CONSORT flowchart showing participant flow from screening (n=500) through randomization to final analysis"
- "Transformer neural network architecture with encoder stack on left, decoder stack on right, showing multi-head attention and cross-attention connections"
- "Biological signaling cascade: EGFR receptor → RAS → RAF → MEK → ERK → nucleus, with phosphorylation steps labeled"
- "Block diagram of IoT system: sensors → microcontroller → WiFi module → cloud server → mobile app"

✗ **Avoid vague prompts**:
- "Make a flowchart" (too generic)
- "Neural network" (which type? what components?)
- "Pathway diagram" (which pathway? what molecules?)


## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Creating neural network architecture diagrams (Transformers, CNNs, RNNs, etc.)
- Illustrating system architectures and data flow diagrams
- Drawing methodology flowcharts for study design (CONSORT, PRISMA)
- Visualizing algorithm workflows and processing pipelines
- Creating circuit diagrams and electrical schematics
- Depicting biological pathways and molecular interactions
- Generating network topologies and hierarchical structures
- Illustrating conceptual frameworks and theoretical models
- Designing block diagrams for technical papers

## How to Use This Skill

**Simply describe your diagram in natural language.** Nano Banana 2 generates it automatically:

```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o output.png
```

**That's it!** The AI handles:
- ✓ Layout and composition
- ✓ Labels and annotations
- ✓ Colors and styling
- ✓ Quality review and refinement
- ✓ Publication-ready output

## Smart Iterative Refinement Workflow

The AI generation system uses **smart iteration** - it only regenerates if quality is below the threshold for your document type:
