# Markdown and Mermaid Writing

## Overview

This skill teaches you — and enforces a standard for — creating scientific documentation
using **markdown with embedded Mermaid diagrams as the default and canonical format**.

The core bet: a relationship expressed as a Mermaid diagram inside a `.md` file is more
valuable than any image. It is text, so it diffs cleanly in git. It requires no build step.
It renders natively on GitHub, GitLab, Notion, VS Code, and any markdown viewer. It uses
fewer tokens than a prose description of the same relationship. And it can always be
converted to a polished image later — but the text version remains the source of truth.

> as well as being a simple 'script language'. This just helps with any downstream rendering
> and especially AI generated images (using mermaid instead of just long form text to
> describe relationships < tokens). Additionally mermaid can render along with markdown for

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Creating **any scientific document** — reports, analyses, manuscripts, methods sections
- Writing **any documentation** — READMEs, how-tos, decision records, project docs
- Producing **any diagram** — workflows, data pipelines, architectures, timelines, relationships
- Generating **any output that will be version-controlled** — if it's going into git, it should be markdown
- Working with **any other skill** — this skill defines the documentation layer that wraps every other output
- Someone asks you to "add a diagram" or "visualize the relationship" — Mermaid first, always

Do NOT start with Python matplotlib, seaborn, or AI image generation for structural or relational diagrams.
Those are Phase 2 and Phase 3 — only used when Mermaid cannot express what's needed (e.g., scatter plots with real data, photorealistic images).

### Why text-based diagrams win

| What matters | Mermaid in Markdown | Python / AI Image |
| ----------------------------- | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
| Git diff readable | ✅ | ❌ binary blob |
| Editable without regenerating | ✅ | ❌ |
| Token efficient vs. prose | ✅ smaller | ❌ larger |
| Renders without a build step | ✅ | ❌ needs hosting |
| Parseable by AI without vision | ✅ | ❌ |
| Works in GitHub / GitLab / Notion | ✅ | ⚠️ if hosted |
| Accessible (screen readers) | ✅ accTitle/accDescr | ⚠️ needs alt text |
| Convertible to image later | ✅ anytime | — already image |

### What Mermaid can express

Mermaid covers 24 diagram types. Almost every scientific relationship fits one:

| Use case | Diagram type | File |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Experimental workflow / decision logic | Flowchart | `(see docs)` |
| Service interactions / API calls / messaging | Sequence | `(see docs)` |
| Data model / schema | ER diagram | `(see docs)` |
| State machine / lifecycle | State | `(see docs)` |
| Project timeline / roadmap | Gantt | `(see docs)` |
| Proportions / composition | Pie | `(see docs)` |
| System architecture (zoom levels) | C4 | `(see docs)` |
| Concept hierarchy / brainstorm | Mindmap | `(see docs)` |
| Chronological events / history | Timeline | `(see docs)` |

## 🔧 Core workflow

### Step 1: Identify the document type

Check if a template exists before writing from scratch:

| Document type | Template |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Pull request record | `templates/pull_request.md` |
| Issue / bug / feature request | `templates/issue.md` |
| Sprint / project board | `templates/kanban.md` |
| Architecture decision (ADR) | `templates/decision_record.md` |
| Presentation / briefing | `templates/presentation.md` |
| Research paper / analysis | `templates/research_paper.md` |
| Project documentation | `templates/project_documentation.md` |
| How-to / tutorial | `templates/how_to_guide.md` |
| Status report | `templates/status_report.md` |

### Step 2: Read the style guide

Before writing any `.md` file: read `(see docs)`.

Key rules to internalize:

- **One H1 per document** — the title. Never more.
- **Emoji on H2 headings only** — one emoji per H2, none in H3/H4
- **Cite everything** — every external claim gets a footnote `[^N]` with full URL
- **Bold sparingly** — max 2-3 bold terms per paragraph, never full sentences
- **Horizontal rule after every `</details>`** — mandatory
- **Tables over prose** for comparisons, configurations, structured data
- **Diagrams over walls of text** — if it describes flow, structure, or relationships, add Mermaid

### Step 3: Pick the diagram type and read its guide

Before creating any Mermaid diagram: read `(see docs)`.
