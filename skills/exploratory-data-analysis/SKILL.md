# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on scientific data files across multiple domains. This skill provides automated file type detection, format-specific analysis, data quality assessment, and generates detailed markdown reports suitable for documentation and downstream analysis planning.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Automatic detection and analysis of 200+ scientific file formats
- Comprehensive format-specific metadata extraction
- Data quality and integrity assessment
- Statistical summaries and distributions
- Visualization recommendations
- Downstream analysis suggestions
- Markdown report generation

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User provides a path to a scientific data file for analysis
- User asks to "explore", "analyze", or "summarize" a data file
- User wants to understand the structure and content of scientific data
- User needs a comprehensive report of a dataset before analysis
- User wants to assess data quality or completeness
- User asks what type of analysis is appropriate for a file

## Supported File Categories

The skill has comprehensive coverage of scientific file formats organized into six major categories:

## Workflow

### Step 1: File Type Detection

When a user provides a file path, first identify the file type:

1. Extract the file extension
2. Look up the extension in the appropriate reference file
3. Identify the file category and format description
4. Load format-specific information

**Example:**
```
User: "Analyze data.fastq"
→ Extension: .fastq
→ Category: bioinformatics_genomics
→ Format: FASTQ Format (sequence data with quality scores)
→ Reference: references/bioinformatics_genomics_formats.md
```

### Step 3: Perform Data Analysis

Use the `scripts/eda_analyzer.py` script OR implement custom analysis:

**Option A: Use the analyzer script**
```python
# The script automatically:
# 1. Detects file type
# 4. Generates markdown report

python scripts/eda_analyzer.py <filepath> [output.md]

**Option B: Custom analysis in the conversation**
Based on the format information from the reference file, perform appropriate analysis:

For tabular data (CSV, TSV, Excel):
- Load with pandas
- Check dimensions, data types
- Analyze missing values
- Calculate summary statistics
- Identify outliers
- Check for duplicates

### Step 4: Generate Comprehensive Report

Create a markdown report with the following sections:

#### Required Sections:
1. **Title and Metadata**
   - Filename and timestamp
   - File size and location

2. **Basic Information**
   - File properties
   - Format identification

3. **File Type Details**
   - Format description from reference

### Step 5: Save Report

Save the markdown report with a descriptive filename:
- Pattern: `{original_filename}_eda_report.md`
- Example: `experiment_data.fastq` → `experiment_data_eda_report.md`

### Reference File Structure

Each format entry includes:
- **Description:** What the format is
- **Typical Data:** What it contains
- **Use Cases:** Common applications
- **Python Libraries:** How to read it (with code examples)
- **EDA Approach:** Specific analyses to perform

**Example lookup:**
```markdown
### .pdb - Protein Data Bank
**Description:** Standard format for 3D structures of biological macromolecules
**Typical Data:** Atomic coordinates, residue information, secondary structure
**Use Cases:** Protein structure analysis, molecular visualization, docking
**Python Libraries:**
- `Biopython`: `Bio.PDB`
