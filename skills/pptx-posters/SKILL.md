# PPTX Research Posters (HTML-Based)

## Overview

**⚠️ USE THIS SKILL ONLY WHEN USER EXPLICITLY REQUESTS PPTX/POWERPOINT POSTER FORMAT.**

For standard research posters, use the **latex-posters** skill instead, which provides better typographic control and is the default for academic conferences.

This skill creates research posters using HTML/CSS, which can then be exported to PDF or converted to PowerPoint format. The web-based approach offers:
- Modern, responsive layouts
- Easy integration of AI-generated visuals
- Quick iteration and preview in browser
- Export to PDF via browser print function
- Conversion to PPTX if specifically needed

## When to Use This Skill

**ONLY use this skill when:**
- User explicitly requests "PPTX poster", "PowerPoint poster", or "PPT poster"
- User specifically asks for HTML-based poster
- User needs to edit poster in PowerPoint after creation
- LaTeX is not available or user requests non-LaTeX solution

**DO NOT use this skill when:**
- User asks for a "poster" without specifying format → Use latex-posters
- User asks for "research poster" or "conference poster" → Use latex-posters
- User mentions LaTeX, tikzposter, beamerposter, or baposter → Use latex-posters

## AI-Powered Visual Element Generation

**STANDARD WORKFLOW: Generate ALL major visual elements using AI before creating the HTML poster.**

This is the recommended approach for creating visually compelling posters:
1. Plan all visual elements needed (hero image, intro, methods, results, conclusions)
2. Generate each element using scientific-schematics or Nano Banana Pro
3. Assemble generated images in the HTML template
4. Add text content around the visuals

**Target: 60-70% of poster area should be AI-generated visuals, 30-40% text.**

### CRITICAL: Poster-Size Font Requirements

**⚠️ ALL text within AI-generated visualizations MUST be poster-readable.**

When generating graphics for posters, you MUST include font size specifications in EVERY prompt. Poster graphics are viewed from 4-6 feet away, so text must be LARGE.

**MANDATORY prompt requirements for EVERY poster graphic:**

```
POSTER FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (STRICTLY ENFORCE):
- ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 3-4 elements per graphic (3 is ideal)
- ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM 10 words total in the entire graphic
- NO complex workflows with 5+ steps (split into 2-3 simple graphics instead)
- NO multi-level nested diagrams (flatten to single level)
- NO case studies with multiple sub-sections (one key point per case)

# ❌ Creates tiny unreadable text
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "Drug discovery workflow: Stage 1 Target ID, Stage 2 Synthesis, Stage 3 Screening, Stage 4 Lead Opt, Stage 5 Validation, Stage 6 Clinical Trial, Stage 7 FDA Approval with metrics." -o figures/workflow.png
```

**Example - CORRECT (3 mega-stages):**
```bash
### CRITICAL: Preventing Content Overflow

**⚠️ POSTERS MUST NOT HAVE TEXT OR CONTENT CUT OFF AT EDGES.**

**Prevention Rules:**

**1. Limit Content Sections (MAXIMUM 5-6 sections):**
```
✅ GOOD - 5 sections with room to breathe:
   - Title/Header
   - Introduction/Problem
   - Methods
   - Results (1-2 key findings)
   - Conclusions


## Core Capabilities

### 1. HTML/CSS Poster Design

The HTML template (`assets/poster_html_template.html`) provides:
- Fixed poster dimensions (36×48 inches = 2592×3456 pt)
- Professional header with gradient styling
- Three-column content layout
- Block-based sections with modern styling
- Footer with references and contact info

### 2. Poster Structure

**Standard Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADER: Title, Authors, Hero Image     │
├─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┤
│ Introduction│   Results   │  Discussion │
│             │             │             │
│   Methods   │   (charts)  │ Conclusions │
│             │             │             │
│  (diagram)  │   (data)    │   (summary) │
├─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┤
│  FOOTER: References & Contact Info      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
